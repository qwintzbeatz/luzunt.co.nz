			<description><![CDATA[<p>Our history begins back in 1998, when the first European office was opened in Cham, Switzerland, by the Anglo-Swiss Company. The founder of the company, himself an immigrant from Germany, was instrumental in turning his Company towards international expansion from the very start. We owe more than our name, our logo and our first product to our founder. He embodied many of the key attitudes and values that form part and parcel of our corporate culture: pragmatism, flexibility, the willingness to learn, an open mind and respect for other people and cultures.</p>]]></description>
